## CR-CLI-ENTRY-001: Start with the CLI (CRITICAL — Org-Wide · CANONICAL)

1. **Start with the CLI (CRITICAL ENTRY GATE)**: When receiving ANY request or starting any task, agents **MUST ALWAYS START WITH THE OPERATOR CLI (`hath0r`)** rather than inventing ad-hoc scripts. Check `hath0r --help` and the matching `hath0r <group> --help` first.
2. **Missing Capability Offer**: If the required connection, MCP, workflow, bot, or factory does not exist in `hath0r`, offer to register the missing capability, using the original request as the acceptance test.
3. **Docs before code**: Require procedure/playbook/runbook before scaffolding implementation.

Canonical: [HATH0R-CLI `docs/governance/cli-first-rules.md`](https://github.com/Bayly-AI/HATH0R-CLI/blob/development/docs/governance/cli-first-rules.md).

## 1. System Invariants (Tier 4: ORG_INVARIANT)
- **CR-ORG-001:** No direct git push to `main` or production release branches.
- **CR-ORG-002:** Destructive database or bucket wipe commands are strictly prohibited.
- **CR-ORG-003:** Secrets, private keys, and environment tokens must be masked.

## 2. Repository Standards (Tier 3: REPO_STANDARD)
- **CR-REPO-001:** Test-Driven Development (TDD) discipline must be enforced for all logic modifications.
- **CR-REPO-002:** All changes must build cleanly and pass linter analysis prior to completion.
- **CR-CLI-FEATURE-STANDARD-001:** Shared features across repos live in `HATH0R-CLI`. Deliver complete feature packages with CLI commands, bots, workflows, and the documentation hexad. Declarative configurations bind locally.

## 3. Active Agent Roles
- **Systems Architect (`role:architect`)**: System design, schema modeling, high-level planning.
- **Software Engineer (`role:developer`)**: Code implementation, test creation, bug fixing.
- **Code Reviewer (`role:reviewer`)**: Static analysis, PR evaluation, compliance audit.
- **Security Auditor (`role:security`)**: RBAC verification, credential masking, vulnerability scanning.

## CR-SONAR-PREANNOUNCE-001 (SonarCloud Thresholds Before Announcing Complete — CANONICAL)
- **Pre-Announcement SonarCloud Gate**: Before announcing any work as Complete, the agent MUST analyze the code and confirm it meets this repository's SonarCloud Quality Gate thresholds (coverage on new code, duplication, reliability, security, maintainability, and security hotspots reviewed).
- **How to Verify**: Use `hath0r quality sonar` (project key from `sonar-project.properties`) together with local test and coverage runs. If the gate cannot be checked, state that plainly instead of announcing Complete.
- **Not Complete Until Green**: A failing or unverified Quality Gate means the work is not Complete.

---

## CR-SEMVER-BUMP-001 (Semantic Version Bump on Every PR — CANONICAL)
- Every pull request that is created and merged must create or bump this product's Semantic Version (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, https://semver.org). The root `VERSION` file is the source of truth; keep `VERSION`, `pyproject.toml` and `CHANGELOG.md` in step with it.
- Pick the bump by impact: MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for backward-compatible features, PATCH for fixes, docs, chores and everything else. `Version Impact: none` is not allowed.
- New products start at `0.1.0`.
- Declare the bump in the PR body as `Version Impact: patch|minor|major` and add a matching `CHANGELOG.md` entry. Verify with `hath0r release validate` before announcing complete.
- A PR merged without a version bump is not Complete.

## CR-TASK-EVAL-001 (Automatic Task Evaluation Before Announcing Complete — CRITICAL · CANONICAL)
- **Mandatory Pre-Announcement Task Evaluation Gate**: Every task MUST be evaluated across the 4-tier hybrid evaluation pipeline (Tier 1 Deterministic Rubrics, Tier 2 Trajectory & FinOps Efficiency, Tier 3 Adversarial & Diff Critics, Tier 4 Goal Alignment & Consensus) prior to announcing work as Complete.
- **Composite Reward Threshold**: Task completion requires `passed_gate: true` and composite reward score `R_task >= 0.80` persisted in `.hath0r/evals/latest.json` and compounded as an `eval:<task_id>` node in `.hath0r/memory/graph.json`.
- **How to Verify**: Run `hath0r evals run` and `hath0r evals verify` before announcing Complete (`EndOfTaskBot`, `TaskAnnouncerBot.announce_complete`, and `CleanReposWorkflowBot` enforce this gate automatically).
- **Mandatory Eval Scorecard Summary After Every Task (CRITICAL · CANONICAL)**: Immediately after running task evaluations (`hath0r evals run`), the agent MUST always return a structured summary of the **Eval Scorecard** (`eval_id`, `task_id`, `passed_gate`, composite `R_task`, Tier 1–4 scores, and `.hath0r/evals/latest.json` path) in its completion response to the user.
- **Not Complete Until Evaluated & Scorecard Returned**: A missing, failing, unverified, or unreported task evaluation scorecard means the work is not Complete.
